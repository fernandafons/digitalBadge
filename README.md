# Digital Badge Project
This project was developed throughout the NLW heat week, which is an event held by [RocketSeat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/) and aims to help developers to reach the next level. I decided to take the 'Origin' path, which is the beginner one even though I have some years of experience because I always felt like there was a lack in my basic knowledge on web development, and it was a great decision. Now I feel ready to keep moving to higher and more challenging steps.
